      "section_title": "Motivation:  Drug combination therapy has become a increasingly promising method in the treatment of cancer. However, the number of possible drug combinations is so huge that it is hard to screen synergistic drug combinations through wet-lab experiments. Therefore, computational screening has become an important way to prioritize drug combinations. Graph neural network have recently shown remarkable performance in the prediction of compound-protein interactions, but it has not been applied to the screening of drug combinations. Results:  In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model based on graph neural networks and attention mechanism to identify drug combinations that can eﬀectively inhibit the viability of speciﬁc cancer cells. The feature embeddings of drug molecule structure and gene expression proﬁles were taken as input to multi-layer feedforward neural network to identify the synergistic drug combinations. We compared DeepDDS with classical machine learning methods and other deep learning-based methods on benchmark data set, and the leave-one-out experimental results showed that DeepDDS achieved better performance than competitive methods. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known pharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive methods by more than 16% predictive precision. Furthermore, we explored the interpretability of the graph attention network, and found the correlation matrix of atomic features revealed important chemical substructures of drugs. We believed that DeepDDS is an eﬀective tool that prioritized synergistic drug combinations for further wet-lab experiment validation.

      "section_title": "Traditional discovery of drug combinations is mainly based on clinical trials and limited to only a few number of drugs (Li et al., 2015), far from meeting the urgent need for anticancer drugs. Due to the great number of possible drug combinations, traditional method is cost-consuming and impractical. With the development of high-throughput drug screening technology, people can simultaneously carry out large-scale screening of drug combinations over hundreds of cancer cell lines (Hertzberg and Pope, 2000, Bajorath, 2002, Macarron et al., 2011). Torres  et al.  utilized yeast to screen a large number of drug combinations and provided a method to identify preferential drug combinations for further testing in human cells (Torres et al., 2013). In despite of high degree of genomic correlation between the original tumor and the derived cancer cell line, in vitro  experiments of high- throughput drug screening still cannot accurately capture the mode of action of drug molecules  in vivo  (Ferreira et al., 2013). Microcalorimetry screening (Kragh et al., 2021) and genetically encoded ﬂuorescent sensors (Potekhina et al., 2021) have been developed to screen eﬀective antimicrobial combinations for in vivo  disease treatment. However, these techniques require skilled operations and complicated experimental procedures. In recent years, the datasets of single drug sensitivities to cancer cell lines increase greatly, such as Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (Barretina et al., 2012) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), which contains drug sensitivities to hundreds of human cancer cell lines, as well as gene expression proﬁles, mutants and copy number variants. Meanwhile, several large-scale data resource of drug combinations have been released. For example, O’Neil  et al. released a large-scale drug pair synergy study, which included more than 20,000 pairwise synergy scores between 38 unique drugs (O’Neil et al., 2016). The famous pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca (Menden et al., 2019) released their drug pair collaboration experiments, which includes 11,576 experiments of 910 drug combinations to 85 cancer cell lines with genome-related information. DrugCombDB (Liu et al., 2020) has collected more than 6,000,000 quantitative drug dose responses, by which they calculated synergy scores to evaluate synergy or antagonism for each drug combination. In addition, quite a few data portal designed to collect drug combinations and relevant knowledge have been developed. The release of above-mentioned data resources motivated the development of computational screening of drug combinations. Many studies have been proposed to explore the vast space of drug combinations to identify synergistic eﬃcacy. For example, classical machine learning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest, successfully predicted the maximal antiallodynic eﬀect of a new derivative of dihydrofuran-2-one (LPP1) used in combination with pregabalin (PGB) in the streptozocin-induced neuropathic pain model in mice (Sa  lat and Sa lat, 2013, Qi, 2012). Recently, the deep learning is increasingly applied to drug development and discovery. For example, DeepSynergy (Preuer et al., 2018) combined the chemical information of drugs and genomic features of cancer cells to predict drug pairs with synergistic eﬀects. TranSynergy (Liu and Xie, 2021) is a mechanism-driven and self-attention boosted deep learning model that integrates information from gene-gene interaction networks, gene dependencies, and drug-target associations to predict synergistic drug combinations and deconvolute the cellular mechanisms. On the other hand, some studies applied SMILES to characterize chemical properties of drugs. For example, Gao et al. used the drug descriptors based on the",

      "section_title": "SMILES to predict drug synergy. Liu et al. regarded the SMILES code as a string and directly input into a convolutional neural network (Liu et al., 2016) to extract drug features for subsequent prediction task. More interesting, graph neural network is used to learn feature representation from drug chemical structure (Wu et al., 2018, Xiong et al., 2019). In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, DeepDDS (Deep Learning for Drug-Drug Synergy prediction), to predict the synergistic eﬀect of drug combinations. First, the drug chemical structure is represented by a graph in which the vertices are atoms and the edges are chemical bonds. Next, a graph convolutional network and attention mechanism is used to compute the drug embedding vectors. By integration of the genomic and pharmaceutical features, DeepDDS can capture important information from drug chemical structure and gene expression patterns to identify synergistic drug combinations to speciﬁc cancer cell lines. We compare DeepDDS to both classical machine learning methods (SVM, RF, GTB and XGBoost) and other latest deep learning (DTF, DeepSynergy and TranSynergy) on benchmark data set, DeepDDS signiﬁcantly outperform other competitive methods. In particular, we conducted leave-one-out experiments to verify that DeepDDS achieved better performance when one drug (combination) or one tissue is not included in the training set. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known pharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive methods by more than 16% predictive precision. We also explored the function of graph attention network in revealing important chemical substructures of drugs, and found the correlation matrix of atomic features showed clustering patterns among atom subgroups during the training process. Finally, we use the trained model to predict novel drug combination and ﬁnd two previously reported synergistic drug combinations in the top 10 predicted results, MK2206 and AZD5363, MK2206 and AZD6244 to HCC1806 breast cancer cells. In summary, we believed that DeepDDS is an eﬀective tool that prioritized synergistic drug combinations for further wet-lab experiment validation.",

The gene expression data of cancer cell lines are obtained from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, Barretina et al., 2012), which is an independent project that makes eﬀort to characterize genomes, mRNA expression, and anti-cancer drug dose responses across cancer cell lines. The expression data is normalized through TPM (Transcripts Per Million) based on the genome-wide read counts matrix. To construct the benchmark set, we obtain the drug combination sensitivity data from a recently released large- scale oncology screening data set (O’Neil et al., 2016), where the viability of 39 cancer cells treated with thousands of drug combinations was evaluated by biochemical assay.

Of note, multiple replicates of one drug combination were assayed in the original data, and thus the average score of the replicates was selected as the ﬁnal synergistic score for each unique drug-pair-cell-line combination. According to the Loewe score, a combination with the score above zero is regarded as synergistic, and with the score below zero is antagonistic. Obviously, the drug combinations with higher synergistic scores are more attractive candidates for further clinical experiments. Since many additive combinations may exist (synergy scores are around 0 due to noise), we choose a stricter threshold to classify the combinations. Particularly, combinations with synergy score higher than 10 are labeled as positive (synergistic), and those with score less than 0 are labeled as negative (antagonistic). This yielded a balanced benchmark set that contains 12,415 unique drug pair-cell line combinations, covering 36 anticancer drugs and 31 human cancer cell lines.",

In a molecule graph,  x i  ∈ V  is the  i -th atom and  e ij  ∈ E  is the chemical bond between the  i -th and  j - th atoms. The chemical molecular graph is non-Euclidean data and lacks of translation invariance, therefore, we applied graph neural network instead of traditional convolution network, to extract drug feature representations based on the graphs. For each node in a graph, we use DeepChem (Ramsundar et al., 2019) to compute a set of atomic attributes as its initial feature. Speciﬁcally, each node is represented as a binary vector including ﬁve pieces of information: the atom symbol, the number of adjacent atoms, the number of adjacent hydrogen, the implicit value of the atom, and whether the atom is in an aromatic structure. In GNN, the learning process of drug representation is actually the message passing between each node and its neighbor nodes.

More precisely, we iteratively exclude each drug combination from the training set, use the remaining data to train the DeepDDS model that is in turn used to predict the sensitivity of the excluded drug combination to cancer cell lines. The result of the leave- one drug combination-out experiment is shown in Table 3, DeepDDS-GAT achieve notably performance by AUC value 0.89, followed by DeepDDS-GCN. It can be also found that DeepDDS signiﬁcantly outperform all other methods. As the leave-one drug combination-out experiment did not excluded single drug from the training set, we next leave one drug out to prevent the information of certain drug being seen by the model. The leave-one drug-out experiment check the potential to learn the important features of unseen drug from the chemical structures of those seen drugs. As shown in Table 3, DeepDDS still achieve better performance than other competitive methods. As previous studies (Liu and Xie, 2021), we also carried out leave-one cell line-out experiment to verify the performance of DeepDDS. Take the cell line T47D as an example, the drug combination between BEZ-235 and MK-8669, Dasatinib, Lapatinib, Geldanamycin, PD325901, Erlotinib, MK-4541, Temozolomide, Vinorelbine, ABT-888, all have a high experimental synergy scores (Loewe > 100). Expectedly, the prediction scores of these drug combinations have prior rankings among all candidate drug pairs (See Supplementary Table S2-S3 for detail). In addition to the leave-one cell line-out evaluation , Preuer et al., 2018), we adopt more rigorous strategy to evaluate our method. We exclude all the cancer cell lines belong to speciﬁc tissue from the training set, so that the model can not see any gene expression information of a certain type of tissue. We iteratively use the excluded cancer cell lines as the validation set and the remaining samples as the training set to train the model.

In fact, the benchmark dataset actually includes only 38 unique drugs and 39 cancer cell lines, while the space for possible drug combinations is much larger when novel drugs are included Two diﬀerent graph neural network, GAT and GCN, are used to learn drug embedding vectors in our method. We extensively compared their performance to each other, as well as to quite a few competitive methods. Overall, GAT performs slightly better than GCN, and thus we further explored the interpretability of the GAT model. However, we have realized that the physicochemical properties of the molecular graph and attention weights between the atoms have not been fully understood. In the future, we are interested in studying the connections between atoms to incorporate more information resources into the DeepDDS model to improve the model interpretability and predictability. In conclusion, we have proposed a novel method DeepDDS to predict the synergy of drug combinations for cancer cell lines with high accuracy. Our performance comparison",

      "section_title": "An earlier step in developing a drug for a certain disease usually involves the search of enormous amount of molecules to create a small subset of candidates for further laboratory testing. To reduce experimental costs and to produce drug candidates more efficiently, many computational approaches have been devel- oped to generate novel molecules [ 6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ]. These approaches usually take some existing molecules as inputs and generate valid but different molecules with high variety. Validity basically means that the generated molecules are possible to be synthesized. At the same time, high variety will ensure that the gen- erated molecules span over a reasonably large molecular space in hope that some of them will have desired properties. Computational approaches are usually evaluated based on these two metrics. Generally speaking, existing computational approaches can be characterized as two different types based on whether they can incorporate certain constrains. For some approaches [ 6 ,  7 ], any molecules can be generated,  i.e. , the generation of molecules has no constraints associated with them. For the second type of approaches [ 8 ,  9 ,  10 ], they only generate molecules satisfying certain constrains. For example, all the generated molecules must include some fixed substructures such as ring structures. In other cases, the constraints can be task specifics, for example, many approaches [ 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ] have been developed to generate molecules that bind to certain protein binding sites. Early computational approaches for molecule generation were mostly applications of generative deep learning models, such as variational autoencoder [ 16 ]. More recently, there was a shift from generations of whole molecules all at once, to iterative generations of atoms and bonds [ 6 ,  8 ]. Many of such approaches utilized GNN modules as backbones to generate molecules with specific substructures or with high binding affinity to specific proteins [ 8 ].",

      "section_title": "Once drug candidates are selected, researchers need to study drugable properties of candidate molecules, such as toxicity and possible adverse effects, water solubility, and binding affinity to target proteins. Exper- imental studies are slow and costly. With quick accumulation of high-quality training data, a great number of computational methods for molecular property prediction have been developed [ 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ], the goals of which are to reduce the need for extensive experimental validation and to accelerate the drug discovery process. Molecular properties can be classified into different categories based on their levels, from molecular level (e.g., quantum mechanics) to physiological level [ 21 ]. Computationally, the tasks of molecular prop- erty prediction can be categorized into two broad classes based on their inputs: predictions based on sin- gle molecules (i.e., drug candidates) [ 17 ,  22 ,  23 ], and predictions of relationships based on two or more molecules (e.g., drug-target or protein-ligand) [ 24 ,  25 ,  26 ]. The predictions based on single molecules can be either classification-based or regression-based. The goal of classification tasks is to predict the pres- ence/absence of certain properties. The regression tasks focus on the prediction of the quantitative value of a particular property of a molecule. Similarly, relationships among molecules [ 27 ,  28 ] can be represented by a binary value or a numerical value. Examples of the former include whether a protein and a target interact. The affinity score between two molecules is an example of the latter. Traditionally, drug property prediction heavily relied on classical machine learning techniques such as random forests or support vector machines [ 2 ], necessitating deep domain knowledge for feature engineer- ing. With the emergence of deep learning, there was a significant shift towards neural network based mod- els [ 2 ,  29 ]. This transition marked a move from one-dimensional string representations of drugs to richer two-dimensional graph and three-dimensional conformation models, broadening the scope and accuracy of drug property prediction. In particular, GNNs, which take in a molecular graph representation and directly",

      "section_title": "In the treatment of complex diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders, combinational drug therapies have shown promise in improving treatment efficacy by targeting multiple biological pathways simultane- ously [ 4 ,  31 ,  32 ]. However, as the number of possible drug combinations grows with the increasing number of available drugs, the potential for undetected and unexpected drug-drug interaction (DDIs) also rises [ 33 ]. Such interactions can lead to reduction of therapeutic effectiveness, adverse side effects [ 34 ], and sometimes increased hospitalization [ 35 ], posing significant challenges to the screening and optimization of combina- tional drug therapies. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods that can precisely predict the drug-drug synergies and adverse interactions to ensure safer and more effective treatments. Strictly speaking, drug combination therapies, which rely on synergistic or additive interactions of drugs to increase efficacy, reduce toxicity, and/or prevent drug resistance, can be treated as one type of drug- drug interactions. In this review, we use the broad definition of drug-drug interactions, which include both synergistic/additive as well as antagonistic/adverse interactions. To predict drug-drug interactions computa- tionally, the inputs usually include representations of drugs and types of interactions. In the simplest case, methods may only focus on the prediction of the existence of a particular type of interaction [ 36 ]. The problem is simply formulated as a binary classification problem. In other cases ( e.g. , data from cell-based assays), the relationships can be quantified based on one or multiple measures of individual drugs and/or drug pairs (e.g., half maximal inhibitory concentration or IC50), which can be viewed as regression tasks. Yet in some other cases (data from patient-based studies), different criteria or biomarkers ( e.g. , blood pres- sure, blood sugar) are considered and only a few categorical values ( e.g. , increasing, no change, decreasing) are considered for each criterion/biomarker. The problem can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem [ 37 ]. Over the years, many computational approaches have been developed for drug-drug interaction predic- tions [ 37 ,  36 ,  38 ,  39 ]. Earlier approaches were mostly based on traditional machine learning algorithms and/or matrix decomposition framework [ 38 ]. Some methods [ 40 ,  41 ,  42 ] can even take into considera- tions of patients’ medical history and recommend drugs that are safe to use for specific patients. More recently, more and more approaches based on deep learning models have drawn increasing attention, and have achieved better performance [ 38 ]. In particular, with advancements in the development of GNNs, methods that adapt GNNs as backbones to incorporate interactions as networks have achieved state-of-the- art results [ 42 ].",

GNNs allow nodes to aggregate information through their edges, creating comprehensive graph representations. Furthermore, by combining graph struc- tures with neural networks, GNNs can readily handle both classification and regression tasks [ 47 ,  48 ,  49 ].

      "section_title": "One of the initial steps in drug discovery involves selecting a set of candidate molecules for early-stage screening. Traditionally, this process has been conducted in laboratories. However, recent advances in com- putational methods have expanded the toolkit available to researchers, including the use of GNN models for molecule generation. These models leverage 2D and 3D graph representations of molecules to effi- ciently generate novel compounds within defined constraints. The development of GNN-based molecule generation methods can be broadly categorized into three types, as illustrated in Fig.  2 : unconstrained gen- eration [ 6 ,  7 ,  50 ,  51 ], constrained generation with targeted substructures [ 8 ,  10 ,  9 ], and ligand-protein-based generation [ 11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ]. Unconstrained methods prioritize structural diversity, constrained approaches focus on generating molecules containing specific functional groups or motifs relevant to desired chemical or biological properties, and ligand–protein-based strategies are designed to produce molecules that interact with specific protein targets. These advances demonstrate the versatility and promise of GNNs in accelerat- ing drug discovery and highlight their pivotal role in identifying novel therapeutic candidates [ 52 ,  53 ,  54 ,  55 ].",

      "section_title": "For computational methods to generate promising drug candidates, a natural approach is to generate chem- ically valid molecules in the vicinity of existing drugs and drug candidates ( i.e. , known training data). In other words, computational models are typically trained on “hit molecules”–compounds that already ex- hibit desirable properties for drug development. Because there are no additional constraints on molecular substructures or chemical properties ( e.g. , binding affinity) imposed explicitly, such methods are classified as unconstrained. The primary goal of such approaches is to generate structurally valid and chemically plausible molecules with high diversity, guided by the distribution of the training data. GraphINVENT [ 56 ] is one of the initial explorations into unconstrained molecular graph generation, which explored various GNN architectures–such as gated GNNs and attention-based GNNs–to learn an “action” probability distribution from training molecules. The model then iteratively sampled one action at a time,  e.g. , adding a bond or an atom, until a “terminate generation” action was reached. Doing so allowed the approach to construct a molecule step by step. GraphINVENT is a representative among a broader class of models [ 57 ,  58 ,  59 ,  60 ] that all adopt such an iterative sampling strategy that build new graphs by repeatedly sampling components or actions from learned distributions. Beyond this one-piece-at-a-time paradigm, another type of method adopted generative frameworks that produce complete molecules (graphs) in a single pass. For instance, ConfVAE [ 61 ] integrated both 2D molecular graphs and 3D conformations, ensuring rotational and translational invariance. It employed a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework, with Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) for graph encoding, enabling end-to-end conditional molecule generation. While ConfVAE leveraged GNNs within a generative framework, VonMisesNet [ 7 ] took a different approach by focusing on capturing the re-",

Moreover, VonMisesNet addressed key challenges such as chirality inversion of atoms and sup- ports molecules with a large number of rotatable bonds-enhancing the chemical accuracy and diversity of its outputs. Overall, unconstrained generation models are increasingly integrating with generative architectures such as VAEs and GANs, aiming to better approximate the true data distribution. Nonetheless, as the need grows to reduce the cost of candidate selection, improve the quality of generated molecules, and generate molecules that could be synthesized, research is gradually shifting toward generation models that incorporate explicit constraints on substructures and target properties.",

      "section_title": "In drug development, generating molecules with specific substructures and targeted chemical properties is often more desirable than unconstrained molecule generation. MoLeR, introduced by Maziarz et al. [ 8 ], demonstrated the capability to perform both constrained and unconstrained molecule generation. It uti- lized motifs–common chemical substructures–within an encoder-decoder framework. By combining GNN and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) blocks, MoLeR carefully constructed molecules one motif at a time, se- quentially selecting motifs or atoms, determining attachment points, and assigning bond types, each step optimized for molecular validity and functionality. Building on the success of fragment-based approaches like MoLeR, newer models have further advanced constrained molecule generation. One such model, GEAM [ 10 ], introduced the Graph Information Bottle- neck (GIB) principle to identify substructures most relevant to specific drug properties. GEAM first extracted a vocabulary of meaningful substructures and then assembled molecules from this learned vocabulary. A soft actor-critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm was used to identify high-quality samples, which were subsequently mutated through a genetic algorithm (GA) to produce final molecules that were chemically valid and aligned with the desired drug properties. While models like MoLeR and GEAM focused primarily on the generation process, MiCam [ 9 ] proposed a novel strategy for building a chemically “reasonable” motif vocabulary. MiCam addressed the limitation of previous fragment-based methods, which often failed to identify appropriate motifs for molecule generation. Its vocabulary construction involved two phases: in the merging-operation learning phase, the model itera- tively merged the most frequent atomic patterns found across molecules to form a preliminary set of motifs. In the motif-vocabulary construction phase, the model disconnected fragments at learned attachment points, marking these connection sites with special tokens to preserve the information necessary for molecule as- sembly. This approach allowed MiCam to flexibly generate molecules either by adding known motifs or by extending partially generated structures based on the connection history. Overall, these models share a common strategy of using substructures as modular building blocks, align- ing generation objectives with the training loss, and constructing molecules in a stepwise manner. Among the three, GEAM and MiCam offer greater flexibility in incorporating specific constraints on both substruc- tures and chemical properties, as they allow the use of both atoms and motifs during generation. In contrast, MoLeR primarily relies on starting from a predefined scaffold.",

These models employ GNN blocks to maintain structural consistency—ensuring robustness against flips, shifts, and rotations—while processing attributes and 3D coordinates of protein binding sites. Approaches such as the AR model [ 11 ] and GraphBP [ 12 ] introduced distinct strategies for representing atoms and binding environments. These models adopted various techniques to prioritize contextual representation and resilience to rigid transformations. For instance, AR combined MLP blocks with an auxiliary network to guide atom gen- eration and bonding decisions, whereas GraphBP utilized spherical coordinates alongside MLPs for se- quential atom-by-atom construction. Other notable methods, including Pocket2Mol [ 13 ] and FLAG [ 14 ], incorporated auxiliary MLP classifiers and predictors to optimize atom positioning and motif attachment. Collectively, these strategies significantly improved model robustness and adaptability, representing critical progress toward customizing molecules for specific protein targets—a key advancement in drug discovery. Each model has distinct strengths: the AR model emphasized specificity and binding affinity optimiza- tion for particular protein site structures; GraphBP introduced a dual-diffusion architecture to enhance flex- ibility; Pocket2Mol achieved greater computational efficiency through conditional 3D coordinate sampling; and FLAG leveraged motif-based generation to improve structural realism and diversity. Beyond generating molecules that bind to specific protein sites, there is also a growing need to gener- ate molecules constrained by a desired 3D binding conformation. In many cases, experimental data reveal that certain binding postures are particularly effective for interacting with specific proteins, and generating candidate molecules that adopt these conformations can greatly accelerate screening. SQUID [ 15 ] was the first model designed to address this challenge. Given a target 3D shape, SQUID encodes the input confor- mation—treated as an unordered point cloud—into hidden features using GNN layers, and then iteratively generates 3D molecular fragments that reconstruct the desired shape fragment-by-fragment.",

In this setting, the choice of molecular fragmentation method is critical, as poor fragmentation can lead to suboptimal motif generation and degraded model performance.

However, such approaches may risk overfitting, as evidenced by performance variability across different datasets. UnifiedPML [ 76 ] further improved representation learning by jointly considering 2D and 3D information in its pre-training scheme.

      "section_title": "Beyond property prediction, interaction prediction has been extensively explored, especially for drug-target or drug -disease interaction predictions. Many researchers (e.g., NeurTN [ 17 ]) have utilized drug-target interaction networks as input, where the nodes are drugs and targets and links are known drug-target rela- tionship. These models typically infer new interactions based on the guilt-by-association principle and are fundamentally different from the methods discussed in this work, which rely primarily on drugs’ structure information represented as molecular graphs. Therefore, interaction network based approaches are excluded from further discussion in this section. In drug discovery, one of the most critical and extensively studied relationships is the interaction between drugs (or chemical compounds) and their protein targets. In the literature, various terms are used to describe these interactions, each emphasizing different aspects. These include drug-target interaction, protein-ligand interaction, drug-target binding affinity, protein-ligand binding affinity, molecular docking. Computation- ally, given the 2D or 3D structures of two molecules, the interaction can be studied at three levels: (1) binary interaction ( i.e. , whether an interaction occurs), (2) binding affinity (a numerical value, typically reflecting binding free energy), and (3) docking or protein-ligand binding dynamics. GNN-based approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions based on their 2D struc- ture. For example, CGIB [ 28 ] predicted interactions primarily using substructure information from paired graphs. MGraphDTA [ 27 ] predicted drug–target binding affinities based on 2D compound graphs and pro- tein sequences. It utilized a deep GNN to capture both local and global molecular structures and a multi- scale convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from protein sequences. However, capturing long-range dependencies within complex molecular graphs remains a challenge for such models. Given the superior performance generally observed when utilizing 3D molecular geometries, the trend shows that more approaches incorporate 3D information for interaction prediction, especially for binding affinity prediction and docking. For binding affinity prediction, the inputs are usually protein-ligand complexes, and the objective is to predict a binding score that reflects the strength of interaction, typically in terms of free energy.

Their method utilized a 3D CNN to capture local spatial features and a spatial GNN to encode global structural information, integrating both in a fused architecture. The IGN framework [ 80 ] modeled protein-ligand complexes using three distinct molecular graphs, each incorporating both 3D structural and chemical properties. MP-GNN [ 81 ] introduced a multiphysical molec- ular graph representation, which systematically captured a wide range of molecular interactions across dif- ferent atom types and physical scales. However, most existing biomolecular GNNs rely on covalent-bond- based graph constructions, which often fail to effectively characterize non-covalent interactions essential for modeling biomolecular complexes. GraphscoreDTA [ 82 ] advanced this field by integrating a bitransport information mechanism and Vina distance optimization terms to better capture the mutual information between proteins and ligands. This method also highlighted critical atomic and residue-level features. In contrast to the above, NERE [ 25 ] proposed an unsupervised approach to binding energy prediction, framing it as a generative modeling task. Their method, based on Neural Euler’s Rotation Equations (NERE), predicted molecular rotations by mod- eling the forces and torques between ligand and protein atoms. However, the current implementation of NERE for antibody modeling only considers backbone atoms and omits side-chain atoms, which are crucial for accurately estimating binding affinity. Docking, a central process in drug discovery, has also seen innovation through GNN-based approaches. E3Bind [ 26 ] introduced an end-to-end model that directly generates ligand coordinates, thus eliminating the need for traditional sampling procedures and coordinate reconstructions. Similarly, FABind [ 83 ] com- bined pocket prediction and docking in an integrated model for fast and accurate binding pose prediction. A unique ligand-informed pocket prediction module was used to guide the docking process, with successive refinements optimizing the ligand-protein binding pose. The model further enhanced the docking process by incrementally integrating the predicted pockets to optimize protein-ligand binding. However, ablation stud- ies indicated that different components contribute to the model’s performance in varying degrees, suggesting potential inefficiencies in the overall architecture. More recently, NeuralMD [ 84 ] provided a fine-grained simulation of protein-ligand binding dynamics. The model included BindingNet, which adhered to group symmetry and captured multi-level interactions, and a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver that modeled the physical trajectories of atoms based on Newtonian mechanics. EquiPocket [ 85 ], distinct from the aforementioned methods, focused specifically on predicting ligand binding sites for given 3D protein structures. It introduced three novel modules: a local geometric modeling module to extract features from individual surface atoms, a global structural module to encode the chem- ical and spatial context of the entire protein, and a surface message-passing module to learn surface-level geometric patterns. In contrast to CNN-based methods, which suffer from inefficiencies due to voxelization of irregular protein surfaces, EquiPocket avoids computational redundancy and excessive memory usage through its surface-based geometric design.",

Early models primarily focused on drug–drug interaction graphs combined with simple node-level drug features. Various GNN architectures were employed to learn low-dimensional representations of drugs from these graphs [ 97 ,  98 ]. Building on this idea, models such as GCNMK [ 36 ] further decomposed the DDI graph into two separate graphs, one representing interactions where a drug in- creases the activity of another, and the other where it decreases activity, and applied two GNNs to learn drug representations from these differentiated views. Subsequent studies expanded the input space by incorpo- rating drug molecular graphs, thereby enabling the integration of both structural and relational perspectives to enhance model performance. For instance, MRCGNN [ 39 ] employed a GNN to process the relational DDI graph while enriching each drug’s feature representation with molecular-level information extracted by a separate GNN operating on its molecular graph. This multimodal approach allowed the model to simulta- neously capture both chemical and interaction-level knowledge. The evolution of problem formulation also extends to the design of prediction tasks. Some models framed DDI prediction as a binary classification problem, aiming solely to determine the existence of an interaction [ 98 ]. Others formulated it as a multi-label classification task, predicting both the presence and the specific type of interaction from a predefined label set [ 99 ,  100 ,  101 ,  102 ]. Many researchers have further distinguished between adverse DDI prediction [ 103 ,  104 ,  105 ] and drug combination or synergy prediction [ 106 ,  105 ,  107 ,  108 ], providing a more nuanced understanding of interaction consequences. Overall, advancements in problem formulation aim to enrich input representations with biologically meaningful information and to enable more fine-grained, application-specific predictions. Future directions are likely to emphasize input data that better reflect the underlying biological complexity of DDIs. For the prediction outcomes, knowledge of specific side effects from adverse interaction prediction and information of targeted diseases in drug combination modeling are welcome additions.",

While this strategy preserves feature information from all modalities, it nei- ther accounts for the relative importance of each data source nor captures potential inter-modal relationships. To address these limitations, more recent models have incorporated attention mechanisms to fuse latent features from different modalities, or from different drugs within the same modality, via cross-attention. For instance, SSF-DDI [ 109 ] utilized two drug representations: the 1D SMILES sequence and the 2D graph structure. Separate architectures (CNN for SMILES and GNN for molecular graphs) were used, and a cross- attention mechanism was employed to integrate the latent features generated by the two models. Similarly, SRR-DDI [ 110 ] constructed 2D molecular graph representations for drug pairs and applied cross-attention to fuse the learned latent features of the two drugs. MD-Syn [ 111 ] proposed a multi-modal architecture with both one-dimensional and two-dimensional feature embedding modules, which allows incorporation of SMILES sequences, cell line information, drug molecular graphs, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. Rather than using cross-attention, MD- Syn introduced a graph-trans pooling module within the 2D-feature embedding module, employing Trans- former encoder layers with multi-head self-attention to process the concatenated latent representations from the PPI network and drug graphs. Another direction in architectural advancement focuses on multi-level feature aggregation across GNN layers, particularly for molecular graphs. For example, DAS-DDI [ 112 ] introduced weighted layer-wise aggregation, where each GNN layer contributes differently to the final embedding. This enables molecular substructures of varying granularity to inform the final drug representation, thereby enhancing the expres- siveness and robustness of the model in capturing complex inter-drug relationships.",

      "section_title": "A distinct line of research focuses on personalized DDI prediction by incorporating patient-specific medical histories. These models are less common due to the fact that data privacy concerns hinder the availability of clinical data, but they offer unique insights. For instance, SafeDrug [ 40 ] used GNNs and RNNs to align molecular features with patient treatment histories, producing compatibility scores for candidate drug combi- nations. MoleRec [ 41 ] leveraged attention mechanisms to integrate patient records and drug representations for safe prescription generation. Despite their promise, challenges remain. GNNs often generate nearly identical embeddings for struc- turally similar molecules, regardless of therapeutic context. Carmen [ 42 ] addressed this with a context- aware GNN that incorporated medication context during atom-level message aggregation. This architecture produced distinct embeddings based on therapeutic relevance, offering a refined strategy for personalized drug combination recommendations. These models incorporating personal information represent a signifi- cant step toward safer, more effective treatment planning, highlighting the value of integrating biomedical knowledge with patient-specific data. Finally, for easy reference, all the approaches discussed in this review for all the three tasks are organized in Table  1 .",

PubChem is organized into three main interlinked databases: PubChem Compound, PubChem Substance, and PubChem BioAssay (PCBA). PubChem Compound database contains information of more than 100 million pure and characterized chemical compounds. The Substance section collects information of substances, including mixtures and uncharacterized substances, submitted by various data contributors. The BioAssay section contains bioactivity results from approximately 1.67 million biological assay experiments. PubChem Compound IDs are widely used across chemical databases for consistent referencing. MoleculeNet  [ 21 ] is a benchmarking platform designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for molecular property prediction. The authors curated a wide variety of datasets from other primary sources, covering different molecular properties and tasks. Although it is not as com- plex as the two database mentioned earlier, it had been utilized frequently in evaluating newly proposed machine learning approaches because the datasets were constructed for specific tasks and were organized in a very simple format for download. Briefly, the datasets cover four different types of properties, including Quantum Mechanics (including datasets QM7, QM8, QM9), Physical Chemistry (datasets ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipophilicity), Biophysics (datasets PCBA, MUV, HIV, BACE), and Physiology (datasets BBBP, Tox21, SIDER, ClinTox). The prediction tasks can be either classification or regression. As a reference, we provide a very brief summary for each of the datasets. QM7, QM8, QM9  provide quantum mechanical properties and 3D molecular geometries that can be used as training data for quantum property prediction. QM7 includes 7,165 molecules computed atomization energies and Coulomb matrices. QM8 includes 21,786 molecules with calculated electronic spectra. QM9 expands to over 133,000 stable organic compounds with detailed quantum mechanical properties including energies, geometries, and vibrational frequencies. ESOL  is small dataset of 1,128 molecules in SMILES format offering water solubility data, useful for evaluating solubility predictions.  FreeSolv  contains 642 small molecules with both experimental and computed hydration free energies.  Lipophilicity  reports log D values of the octanol–water distribution coefficients for over 4,200 drug molecules, reflecting membrane permeability and solubility. PCBA  contains activity profiles for over 400,000 molecules against specific enzymes, receptors, and pathways, derived from PubChem BioAssay database.  MUV  is a filtered subset of PubChem BioAssay, designed to validate virtual screening techniques and includes 17 benchmark tasks.  HIV  contains more than 41 thousand molecules labeled for their ability to inhibit HIV replication based on biological assay data. BACE  includes 1,513 inhibitors of human  β -secretase 1 (BACE-1), with both binary activity labels and IC50 values. BBBP  includes more than two thousand molecules labeled based on whether they can cross the blood- brain barrier.  Tox21  contains toxicity data for close to eight thousand compounds across 12 targets, used in toxicology modeling.  ToxCast  extends Tox21, with bioactivity measurements on 617 biological targets for 8,576 compounds.  SIDER  focuses on close to fifteen hundred marketed drugs and their recorded adverse drug reactions (more than five thousand side effects).  ClinTox  contains approved drugs and compounds that failed clinical trials due to toxicity concerns.

We therefore list two popular databases here: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database (MIMIC-III [ 115 ] and MIMIC-IV [ 116 ]), and the UK Biobank database [ 117 ]. MIMIC-III  [ 115 ] and  MIMIC-IV  [ 116 ] are freely accessible, large-scale clinical databases developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. While MIMIC-IV is an updated and improved version of MIMIC-III, and there are overlapped samples in the two database, MIMIC-IV does not encompass all the data present in MIMIC-III. We briefly discuss both databases. MIMIC-III contains de-identified health- related data associated with over 40,000 patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Dea- coness Medical Center (BIDMC) between 2001 and 2012. The database includes a wide range of data types across 26 tables, such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, medications, diagnostic codes (ICD-9), procedures, imaging reports, and clinical notes. Its structured and time-stamped data makes it es- pecially valuable for developing and validating models for disease risk and patient trajectory prediction. In addition, the dataset has also been frequently employed in studies on drug recommendations and drug com- bination recommendations after extensive preprocessing. On the other hand MIMIC-IV includes detailed, de-identified clinical data for 180,733 patients for hospital admissions and 50,920 patients for ICU admis- sions from BIDMC between 2008 and 2019. Information available includes patient measurements, orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and de-identified free-text clinical notes. Both datasets support a wide array of research studies and help to reduce barriers to conducting clinical research using patient level data. UK Biobank  [ 117 ] is another large-scale biomedical database and research resource containing in-depth genetic, lifestyle, and health information from approximately 500,000 volunteer participants aged 40–69 at the time of recruitment (2006–2010) across the United Kingdom. It is managed by a charitable organiza- tion and made available to approved researchers for health-related research. The dataset includes a broad array of data types, such as genotyping and whole-genome sequencing, biochemical assays, physical mea- sures, imaging data (e.g., MRI, CT scans), hospital and primary care records, and detailed lifestyle and demographic questionnaires. UK Biobank is particularly valuable for population-level studies on complex diseases. The integration of genetic with phenotypic and clinical data makes it one of the most important resources for identifying drug targets, predicting drug effects, and accelerating drug development.",

These resources combine experimental structures with computationally refined conformations to support a range of applications – from physics-based simulations such as free energy cal- culations to data-driven machine learning models that predict binding affinity or molecular properties. In this subsection, we highlight four widely used structural datasets:  ZINC  [ 118 ],  GEOM  [ 119 ],  MISATO  [ 84 ], and  CrossDocked  [ 121 ]. ZINC  [ 118 ] is a meticulously curated repository containing over 230 million commercially accessible compounds. It includes 3D structures, physicochemical properties, and vendor metadata. Unlike theoret- ical libraries, ZINC focuses on experimentally testable molecules, facilitating streamlined drug discovery workflows. The database provides SMILES strings, 3D structures, and drug-like property classifications, organized into tranches for targeted virtual screening. As a benchmark for docking and virtual screening studies, ZINC accelerates the transition from computational predictions to experimental validation, serving as a critical tool for hit identification and lead optimization. GEOM  [ 119 ] contains quantum mechanics-optimized 3D geometries for approximately 30 million con- formers representing 450,000 drug-like molecules.

Its high accuracy has substantially advanced 3D-aware machine learning models for molecular property prediction and molecule generation. MISATO  [ 84 ] is a machine learning-oriented dataset comprising roughly 20,000 experimentally re- solved protein–ligand complexes. Each complex undergoes structural refinement and quantum-mechanical optimization to address stereochemical, geometric, and protonation inconsistencies. Around 17,000 com- plexes are further subjected to explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This dynamic data captures conformational flexibility and binding pocket dynamics. In addition, MISATO includes quantum- derived electronic descriptors, partial charges, and preprocessing utilities tailored for machine learning pipelines. By integrating static structures with time-resolved dynamics, MISATO enables modeling of tran- sient binding states and induced-fit effects, overcoming the limitations of single-conformation datasets. CrossDocked  [ 121 ] curates 18,450 non-redundant protein–ligand complexes derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 132 ], using a systematic cross-docking approach. Ligands are docked into non-cognate, structurally similar binding pockets to produce a diverse set of over 22.5 million binding poses. The dataset features cluster-based predefined splits for evaluating model generalizability to unseen targets and provides dual metrics for assessing both pose accuracy and binding affinity predictions. By modulating the structural similarity between docking receptors and their native counterparts, CrossDocked enables rigorous evaluation of docking algorithms under realistic scenarios where exact receptor structures may be unknown. Designed as a comprehensive benchmark, CrossDocked supports the standardized training and evaluation of 3D CNNs and other ML models for non-native protein–ligand interaction modeling, with broad implications for virtual screening.",

ChEMBL  [ 122 ] is a manually curated database focusing on bioactive molecules with drug-like prop- erties. To assess the binding affinity of small-molecule ligands to their targets, ChEMBL primarily uses experimental bioactivity data extracted from scientific literature. To facilitate comparison and analysis, data from different sources undergoes a standardization process so that measurement type, value, and units are comparable. In addition to binding affinity measurements, ChEMBL also contains rich information about compounds, targets, experimental assays, and original sources. The current release of ChEMBL (release 35) includes approximately 2.5 million distinct compounds and 21.1 million bioactivity measurements derived from 1.7 million biological assays across 16,000 biomolecular targets.

It contains over 150,000 kinase inhibitory measurements, comprising more than 3,800 compounds tested against 172 different protein ki- nases. Based on these measurements, the authors constructed a comprehensive kinome interaction network, enabling systematic analysis of kinase–inhibitor interactions. This dataset is applicable not only to binding affinity prediction but also to the design of multi-kinase inhibitors. Davis Dataset  [ 125 ] was developed by Davis et al. to provide a broad target panel covering over 80% of the human catalytic kinome. It includes selectivity profiles of 72 kinase inhibitors tested against 442 human kinases. With more than 30,000 high-precision measurements obtained from a standardized binding assay, the dataset supports various tasks such as binding affinity prediction, selectivity profiling, off-target prediction, and regression model validation. The uniform experimental design and extensive kinase coverage make the dataset a preferred benchmark for visually screening compound libraries and identifying novel inhibitors. Via a systematic evaluation of target selectivity profiles across three different biochemical assays of kinase inhibitors, Tang et al. [ 124 ] introduced a model-based approach and a unified affinity metric known as the “KIBA score”, to integrate complementary information captured by different bioactivity types. The resulting  KIBA Dataset  comprises a drug–target bioactivity matrix involving 52,498 chemical compounds and 467 kinase targets, with a total of 246,088 KIBA scores. This statistically harmonized dataset, designed to minimize experimental variability, has become a widely used benchmark for training machine learning models in drug–target affinity prediction.",

      "section_title": "While comprehensive resources such as DrugBank include DDI information, they often require additional processing to extract pure interaction data. Furthermore, they may not include all the measurements from high-throughput screening assays, for example, dose responses for different dose combinations of drug pairs. Below, we highlight some widely used datasets for both adverse and synergistic DDI prediction tasks. For adverse or general DDI prediction, commonly used datasets include TWOSIDES [ 127 ], Deng’s Dataset [ 128 ], and ChChMiner [ 129 ]. TwoSIDES  [ 127 ] is a database of polypharmacy side effects for pairs of drugs. It was constructed by mining the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting systems (FAERS) [ 133 ]. The dataset consists of 868,221 statistically significant association between 59,220 drug pairs and 1,301 adverse events. Only associations that cannot be clearly attributed to either drug alone were included. It improves the detection and prediction of adverse effects of drug interactions. Deng’s Dataset  [ 128 ] consists of 74,528 distinct drug–drug interactions among 572 approved drugs extracted from DrugBank entries by appling NLP algorithms. Each interaction is recorded as a four-element tuple: ( drug A ,  drug B ,  mechanism ,  action ), where the ‘mechanism’ means the effect of drugs in terms of the metabolism, the serum concentration, the therapeutic efficacy and so on. The ‘action’ represents increase or decrease. The categorization of interactions into different types of mechanism of actions is",

      "section_title": "useful for understanding the actual logic hidden behind the combined drug usage or adverse reactions and for evaluating algorithms that aim to recover them. ChChMiner  is a sub-dataset from the Stanford Biomedical Network Dataset Collection (BioSNAP) [ 129 ], which itself is a comprehensive database providing information about relationships between a variety of bi- ological, chemical, or clinical entities including drugs. ChChMiner is a network of interactions among 1,514 FDA-approved drugs, extracted from drug labels, scientific publications, and DrugBank, with 48,514 drug–drug interactions. For synergistic DDI prediction, we include an aggregated dataset from various sources (DrugCombDB [ 130 ]) and two high-throughput screening data of drug pairs on cancer cell lines (O’Neil’s Dataset [ 131 ] and AstraZeneca’s Dataset [ 31 ]).  DrugCombDB  [ 130 ] aggregated drug combination data from various data sources: high-throughput screening assays of drug combinations, manual curations from the literature, FDA- approved therapies and failed clinical trials, as well as some earlier drug combination databases such as DCDB [ 134 ]. The database comprises 448,555 drug combinations involving 2,887 unique drugs and 124 human cancer cell lines. In addition, DrugCombDB has more than 6,000,000 quantitative dose responses from which multiple synergy scores to determine the overall synergistic or antagonistic effects of drug com- binations were calculated based on different models. As a comprehensive database with a large number of drug combinations, DrugCombDB would greatly facilitate and promote the discovery of novel synergistic drugs for the therapy of complex diseases. By using a high-throughput platform for unbiased identification of synergistic and additive drug combi- nations, O’Neil et al. [ 131 ] created a dataset comprising 38 experimental or approved drugs tested across 39 diverse cancer cell lines, using a 4-by-4 dosing regimen for a total of 583 drug–drug combinations. More recently, a similar but larger dataset was created by AstraZeneca and shared with the research community through a DREAM Challenge [ 31 ], which consisted of 11,576 experiments from 910 combinations of 118 drugs across 85 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines. Both datasets can serve as benchmark datasets and can accelerate the development of computational approaches for drug combination synergy prediction.",

      "section_title": "Deep learning models require large volumes of high-quality data to effectively capture the complex rela- tionships between molecular entities and to predict properties of chemical compounds. However, several limitations still hinder progress. First of all, substantial heterogeneity exists in different databases. Data often comes in different formats with different identifiers, making integration and standardization difficult. Data derived from different labs or measurement techniques may not be comparable, limiting transferability. In the extreme cases, different sources may report contradictory effects or properties for the same compound. Secondly, considerable biases exist in different data sources. Almost all the databases have the coverage bias: most datasets focus on well-studied proteins, pathways, diseases, and only a small portion of theoreti- cally limitless set of all possible chemical compounds, leaving gaps in knowledge for novel targets, rare dis- eases, and novel drug candidates. Underrepresented molecular classes such as biotech medicines/biologics are often excluded due to lack of structured data. In addition, many datasets consist of label biases, includ- ing imbalance labels, and noisy and incomplete labels. Many datasets consist of only positive (or negative) samples because of the nature of the datasets. For example, drug-drug interactions were mostly reported when side effects were observed, which only provided positive samples. On the contrary, failed clinical trials only contained negative results. Label imbalance makes the prediction challenging and motivates the development of pre-training and few-shot learning algorithms. Some benchmark datasets, especially those with smaller sizes, have dataset specific biases. Models trained on those datasets may suffer from overfitting and not generalize well.",

      "section_title": "In recent years, deep learning approaches – particularly GNNs – have garnered increasing attention in the field of computational drug discovery. In this survey, we systematically review studies published since 2021, highlighting the significant role GNNs have played across three core application areas: molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and drug–drug interaction prediction. We examine how GNNs effectively model chemical structures and capture complex molecular patterns, discussing the strengths and limitations of current approaches, along with the major challenges faced by the research community. The papers included in this review represent state-of-the-art advancements in the field and demonstrate that molecular graph representation learning has become a dominant paradigm across these applications. Specifically, we observe that GNNs have been instrumental in advancing molecule generation by en- abling the design of novel compounds with desired properties through both unconstrained and constrained generation strategies. In the area of molecular property prediction, the shift towards utilizing 3D molecular graphs has led to more accurate and robust outcomes, particularly when combined with message-passing mechanisms and contrastive learning techniques. For DDI prediction, GNNs have opened promising av- enues in personalized medicine by identifying safe and effective drug combinations tailored to individual patient profiles. This is especially impactful for drug repurposing, where GNNs can significantly accelerate the development of combinatorial therapies. Across the reviewed studies, several common trends emerge. First, pre-training and self-supervised learning have become widespread, substantially enhancing the performance of GNN-based models. These techniques are particularly effective in mitigating the issue of limited labeled data and contribute to the development of more generalizable models. Second, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge into GNN architectures has led to noticeable improvements in model performance, suggesting a movement to- ward more specialized and biologically informed models. Third, many recent works adopt multi-modal approaches that integrate diverse input formats, including 2D and 3D molecular graphs, as well as SMILES strings, sometimes combining GNNs with other deep learning architectures. This fusion of complementary molecular representations enables a more comprehensive understanding of the data and has the potential to significantly enhance predictive performance. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain, which also point to promising future directions. First, as previously discussed, data scarcity and the limited availability of high-quality, diverse datasets con- tinue to constrain the full potential of GNNs in drug discovery. Second, the interpretability of GNN models remains a critical hurdle that must be addressed to foster trust and facilitate their adoption in real-world applications. As GNN architectures grow increasingly complex, ensuring interpretability is paramount. As emphasized by Henderson et al. [ 135 ], future research should prioritize models that not only provide accurate predictions but also offer clear explanations for their decisions. Bridging this gap between computational predictions and human understanding will be essential for generating actionable scientific insights. Lastly, multi-omics integration approaches combine data from various biological levels (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.) to create a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms. Integration of GNN-based models with multi-omics data holds significant promise and could",

For example, in liability screening, an Overconﬁdent False Negative (OFN hereafter) prediction leads the GNN model to mark a toxic molecule as safe, causing severe conse- quences by leaking it to the next stage of drug development. Such concern is further exacerbated by a second key characteristic of the drug discovery tasks:  data distributional shift ; drug discovery tasks often explicitly evaluate novel molecules by moving into regions in the feature space that are not previously represented in training data. As a result, the testing molecules are characteristically distinct from the training data, and can carry novel toxic signatures that were previously unseen by the model. A model with just high in-distribution accuracy is not sufﬁcient under those situations; quantifying model reliability and designing techniques to improve robustness against overconﬁdence under distributional shift become especially relevant.",

      "section_title": "Using CardioTox, our second contribution is an exploratory study on the root causes behind the overconﬁdent mispredictions under distributional shift, and principled modeling approaches to miti- gate it. In particular, we observe that many overconﬁdently mispredicted molecules are structurally distinct from training data (i.e., they are \"far\" from training data based on molecule-ﬁngerprint graph distance [ Rogers and Hahn ,  2010 ], see Section  3 ). This failure mode suggests that improving the distance-awareness  of a GNN model would be an effective solution: a test molecule that is far away from the decision boundary (e.g., a toxic but novel molecule, due to its novelty, may possess few prior toxic signatures deﬁning the decision boundary) should still get low conﬁdence if it’s distant from training data. To this end, the recently proposed Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGP) [ Liu et al. ,  2020 ] demonstrates a concrete approach to achieve this goal. Speciﬁcally, it imposes a distance-preserving regularization (i.e., spectral normalization) to the feature extractor, and replaces the dense output layer with a distance-aware classiﬁer (i.e., random-feature Gaussian process). SNGP has shown promising robustness improvements in vision and language problems. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to bring the distance-aware design principle to GNN models to to improve reliability performance on the molecule graph.",

We take the latent representations learned by GNN baseline, GNN-GP and GNN-SNGP (increasing distance- preservation) and feed them to classiﬁers with increasing distance-awareness: Dense layer, GP-layer, exact Gaussian processes classiﬁer (GPC hereafter). Table  S2  suggests there’s synergy between distance-preservation of neural representation and distance-awareness of the classiﬁer. With the least distance-aware classiﬁer (i.e., Dense layer), AUROC drops when increasing distance-preservation in neural representation. With the most distance-aware classiﬁer (i.e., exact GPC), increasing neural representation’s distance-preservation beneﬁts accuracy, robustness as well as overconﬁdence reduction. We ﬁnd a GNN model achieves best performances when both are present in the architecture (GNN-SNGP embeddings with GPC). Interesting, naively increasing distance-preservation along is not sufﬁcient in guaranteeing good generalization; we observe that the pre-deﬁned representation (i.e., the molecule ﬁngerprint FP) gives relatively low AUROC under data shifts (e.g., on Test-OOD2) despite being perfectly distance-preserving.

Existing biomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from dense biomedical KGs. These paths enable prediction of unobserved drug–drug and drug–disease interactions, includ- ing those involving entities not seen during training, thus sup- porting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free and employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen’s algorithm to extract the K shortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing bio- logically relevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise, interpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or GNNs to improve generalization, accu- racy, and enable explainable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot reasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing tasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks.

While typical KGs contain thousands of nodes and millions of edges, only a small subgraph is relevant for a given task [ 45 ], limiting practical utility in domains like drug discovery, where precise, targeted insights are critical. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in leveraging KGs for drug discovery, excelling in link prediction and capturing biological relationships [ 21 ,  34 ,  47 ]. However, GNNs incur high computational costs on large-scale KGs [ 1 ] and criti- cally fail to generalize to unseen entities [ 18 ], a drawback in drug discovery where new drugs and diseases continuously emerge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, ex- celling in zero-shot reasoning and inductive generalization [ 3 ,  4 ,  23 ]. Recent works have shown that LLMs can be grounded in KGs to enhance factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations in specialized domains [ 2 ,  3 ,  14 ,  41 ]. However, extracting meaningful insights from KGs using LLMs is an ongoing challenge [ 15 ,  33 ]. Current approaches to KG integration often exhibit limitations. General- purpose methods like [ 29 ,  30 ,  35 ] focus on narrow tasks such as question answering or binary classification, using extraction meth- ods that struggle to scale to dense biomedical KGs. Conversely, biomedical-specific approaches like [ 46 ] are tightly coupled to GNN architectures, hindering their direct integration with modern LLMs without substantial modifications. Addressing these limitations is crucial for developing a generalizable and scalable framework for drug discovery. We introduce  “K-Paths” , a novel model-agnostic retrieval frame- work designed to extract highly relevant entities and relation- ships from large biomedical KGs to aid in predicting unobserved drug–disease and drug–drug interactions, including those involv- ing entities unseen during training. Unlike traditional approaches, K-Paths generates structured, interpretable multi-hop paths directly usable by LLMs, enabling efficient and accurate zero-shot reasoning.",

      "section_title": "K-Paths is particularly valuable in drug discovery, where identi- fying such interactions can facilitate drug repurposing and safer treatment opportunities. Figure 1 illustrates the problem K-Paths ad- dresses: we aim to predict unobserved interactions between known and emerging entities (or between two emerging entities), where no interaction of interest has been observed previously. This formula- tion establishes an inductive reasoning setting, enabling predictions beyond observed edges. K-Paths is training-free and operates in three steps as shown in fig. 2. First, it augments the biomedical KG by integrating observed interactions from training data, enhancing its representation of interactions. This enriched KG serves as the network for retrieving biologically meaningful connections. Next, it retrieves biologically meaningful connections using our diversity-aware adaptation of Yen’s algorithm [ 44 ]. While Yen’s algorithm iteratively finds alter- native shortest paths, our adaptation prioritizes relational diversity and biological relevance over redundant shortest-path variations. Finally, the retrieved paths are transformed into natural language representations, enabling LLMs to reason over them and effectively predict interactions. These paths can also be used to construct task- specific subgraphs, allowing GNN models to operate on a more focused graph and substantially reducing computational overhead. We evaluate K-Paths in both zero-shot generative and supervised learning settings on drug repurposing and drug–drug interaction (DDI) tasks involving emerging entities. Experiments show that K- Paths significantly enhances LLM reasoning in a zero-shot setting: on DDI severity prediction, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 F1 points, and on drug repurposing tasks, by 4.0. Llama 70B achieves similar gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks, respectively. In supervised settings, K-Paths reduces KG size by 90% and improves training efficiency for EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN model, [ 46 ], without significant loss in performance. More importantly, the retrieved paths provide interpretable rationales for predicted inter- actions, enhancing explainability and offering valuable biological insights.",

We focus on predicting unobserved interactions among existing and emerging drugs or diseases, as well as interactions involving emerging drugs or diseases.

      "section_title": "GNNs, including variants of graph convolutional networks, have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the structure of biomedical KGs and predicting unobserved interactions between en- tities [ 27 ,  38 ,  46 ]. These models often leverage external KGs such as Hetionet [ 20 ] to learn richer representations of biomedical entities. However, training on large-scale KGs is computationally expensive. To address scalability, recent methods like [ 38 ,  45 ] extract fixed- sized subgraphs before passing them to the graph network. While effective, these approaches are typically designed for transductive settings, where both nodes involved in a prediction are observed during training. This limits their ability to generalize to emerging entities, a critical need in drug discovery. In this work, we operate in the inductive setting, aiming to predict interactions involving unseen drugs or diseases. Our work is closely related to EmerGNN [ 46 ], which augments the training network with Hetionet and uses a flow-based model to extract paths and construct subgraphs for GNN processing. How- ever, EmerGNN requires a separately trained model and relies on beam search to generate paths tailored for graph architectures. In contrast, K-Paths is training-free, retrieves diverse and biologi- cally meaningful paths with minimal computational overhead, and supports model-agnostic integration with GNNs and LLMs. This flexibility enables K-Paths to support both supervised and zero- shot learning. Furthermore, in section 5, we show that integrating K-Paths into EmerGNN improves efficiency and performance com- pared to using the entire KG. K-Paths also significantly improves LLM zero-shot performance without any parameter updates.",

Our diverse path retrieval algorithm retrieves a set of  𝐾 short- est diverse paths between two entities,  { 𝑢, 𝑣 } , from  G  using Yen’s algorithm [ 44 ]. We prioritize shortest paths for several reasons. Shorter paths capture stronger, more interpretable relationships, while longer paths introduce noise and uncertainty [ 6 ,  26 ]. Finally, empirical studies on biomedical KGs further show that meaningful interactions typically occur within a few hops[19, 47]. Yen’s algorithm extends Dijkstra’s algorithm [ 10 ] by iteratively computing shortest paths while temporarily excluding specific edges, thus generating progressively longer, loop-free alternatives. The output from this process contains relationally redundant paths. Therefore, we introduce a filtering algorithm (algorithm 1) to re- move these redundancies. Our filtering algorithm eliminates paths with duplicate relation sequences of the same path length. This filtering step results in a diverse set of paths, which are passed to the next module in our framework.

In the zero-shot setting, these textualized paths are appended to the original query, providing contextual information for the LLM to perform inference.

Furthermore, representing the retrieved paths in natural language enhances the explainability of the LLM’s predictions. GNN interaction prediction For GNN-based prediction, instead of directly inputting the large augmented KG into the GNN, we use the diverse paths to construct smaller, query-specific subgraphs. This approach significantly reduces the computational complex- ity and allows GNN to focus on the most relevant information. During training, the GNN learns entity-specific representation by aggregating information from known drug-drug or drug-disease in- teractions and their corresponding query-specific subgraphs. These learned representations are then used to predict the type of inter- action between entity pairs. During testing, we extend the learned representation space by incorporating new test nodes and their corresponding query-specific subgraphs.

We assume there is no direct link between the query entities whose interaction we aim to predict, and the model must infer the interaction type by reasoning over existing facts in the KG. To prevent data leakage, we explicitly check and remove direct interaction links between entities during training and verify their absence in the test set.

Table 2 presents results across multiple LLM sizes and domains on the DDInter, PharmacotherapyDB, and DrugBank datasets. Consistent improvements with K-Paths:  Across all datasets, LLMs significantly benefit from K-Paths, outperforming both Base and Definitions settings. On DDInter, K-Paths boosts the F1-score by 13.42 for Llama 3.1 8B and 6.18 for Llama 3.1 70B, compared to the Definitions setting. Similar gains appear on PharmacotherapyDB with improvements of 12.45 (8B) and 8.46 (70B). The Tx-Gemma models (9B/27B), specifically fine-tuned for therapeutic tasks, show remarkable gains with K-Paths—achieving 29.2 and 19.8 point F1- score improvements on DDInter, respectively. In some cases, Defi- nitions slightly improve performance over Base or even degrade it, but they consistently fall short of the substantial gains achieved with K-Paths. This gap likely stems from the nature of the informa- tion provided. K-Paths offers structured, contextualized knowledge, showing how entities are related. Definitions, while informative, provide declarative knowledge that lacks crucial relational context, needed for LLMs to reason about interactions effectively. The harder the task, the larger the gap:  DrugBank involves 86 interaction types. In the Base setting, most models hover around 1% F1 or 19% BERTScore, whereas with K-Paths they achieve 30–40%, emphasizing the importance of structured external knowledge in such complex tasks. K-Paths eases need for scale & domain-specific models: Larger models generally outperform smaller ones in the Base set- ting (e.g., 70B vs. 8B Llama), but these gains diminish with external knowledge. Surprisingly, on DDInter, smaller models (8B Llama, Qwen 14B) occasionally outperform their larger counterparts when using K-Paths, suggesting high-quality external knowledge can reduce reliance on model scale. Likewise, Tx-Gemma’s domain- specific pre-training only helps consistently on Pharmacothera- pyDB. However, their performance varies across datasets, suggest- ing domain specialization doesn’t guarantee optimal reasoning.

This highlights the advantage of a more focused graph structure for such models. This result is consistent in the transductive setting shown in appendix F.2. Efficiency analysis:  Table 5 presents a comparison of graph statistics and training times before and after applying K-Paths for subgraph retrieval, along with the retrieval duration in minutes. The results clearly show that K-Paths substantially reduces the num- ber of nodes, relations, and triplets, leading to significantly faster training and lower memory overhead. For instance, on DrugBank, the number of nodes reduces from 35,103 to 6,335, and triplets from 1,789,976 to 184,273. Correspondingly, EmerGNN’s training time per epoch drops from 1011.86s to 146.98s.. A similar trend is ob- served in DDInter, where subgraph pruning leads to a speedup from 606.24s to 102.21s per epoch. Note that K-Paths includes reverse edges during retrieval, effectively doubling the triplet count. De- spite this, the total retrieval time remains under 15 minutes for all datasets. We see a similar trend in table 8 for the test data and show the important relations retained by K-Paths in appendix F.4.

      "section_title": "We present  K-Paths , a model-agnostic retrieval framework that introduces a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen’s algorithm to ex- tract biologically meaningful, multi-hop reasoning paths from large biomedical KGs. These paths serve as structured, relational evi- dence that supports both prediction and interpretability across model types. Our experiments show that K-Paths benefits both LLMs and GNNs. For LLMs, the retrieved paths serve as useful con- text that enables zero-shot, inductive reasoning about unobserved drug–disease interactions. For GNNs, K-Paths identifies compact subgraphs, reducing graph size by up to 90% while maintaining performance and improving training efficiency. While our focus is on repurposing and interaction prediction, K-Paths is potentially generalizable to other biomedical tasks such as protein–protein interaction prediction or treatment recommendation. We acknowl- edge limitations: K-Paths relies on existing interaction types and graph connectivity, which may limit its ability to infer entirely novel interaction types or handle sparsely represented entities. Neverthe- less, by anchoring predictions in relationally diverse paths, K-Paths mitigates hallucinations and supports biologically grounded infer- ence. To our knowledge, K-Paths is one of the first frameworks to enable path-based heuristics for reasoning over unseen drug pairs, a critical need for early-stage drug discovery. We believe this work lays a foundation for future exploration of integrating LLMs and KGs in biomedical applications, paving the way for more efficient and interpretable solutions in drug discovery and other related fields.",

However, the number of possible drug combinations is so huge that it is hard to screen synergistic drug combinations through wet-lab experiments. Therefore, computational screening has become an important way to prioritize drug combinations. Graph neural network have recently shown remarkable performance in the prediction of compound-protein interactions, but it has not been applied to the screening of drug combinations. Results:  In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model based on graph neural networks and attention mechanism to identify drug combinations that can eﬀectively inhibit the viability of speciﬁc cancer cells. The feature embeddings of drug molecule structure and gene expression proﬁles were taken as input to multi-layer feedforward neural network to identify the synergistic drug combinations. We compared DeepDDS with classical machine learning methods and other deep learning-based methods on benchmark data set, and the leave-one-out experimental results showed that DeepDDS achieved better performance than competitive methods. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known pharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive methods by more than 16% predictive precision. Furthermore, we explored the interpretability of the graph attention network, and found the correlation matrix of atomic features revealed important chemical substructures of drugs. We believed that DeepDDS is an eﬀective tool that prioritized synergistic drug combinations for further wet-lab experiment validation.

Liu et al. regarded the SMILES code as a string and directly input into a convolutional neural network (Liu et al., 2016) to extract drug features for subsequent prediction task. More interesting, graph neural network is used to learn feature representation from drug chemical structure (Wu et al., 2018, Xiong et al., 2019). In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, DeepDDS (Deep Learning for Drug-Drug Synergy prediction), to predict the synergistic eﬀect of drug combinations. First, the drug chemical structure is represented by a graph in which the vertices are atoms and the edges are chemical bonds. Next, a graph convolutional network and attention mechanism is used to compute the drug embedding vectors. By integration of the genomic and pharmaceutical features, DeepDDS can capture important information from drug chemical structure and gene expression patterns to identify synergistic drug combinations to speciﬁc cancer cell lines. We compare DeepDDS to both classical machine learning methods (SVM, RF, GTB and XGBoost) and other latest deep learning (DTF, DeepSynergy and TranSynergy) on benchmark data set, DeepDDS signiﬁcantly outperform other competitive methods. In particular, we conducted leave-one-out experiments to verify that DeepDDS achieved better performance when one drug (combination) or one tissue is not included in the training set. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known pharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive methods by more than 16% predictive precision. We also explored the function of graph attention network in revealing important chemical substructures of drugs, and found the correlation matrix of atomic features showed clustering patterns among atom subgroups during the training process. Finally, we use the trained model to predict novel drug combination and ﬁnd two previously reported synergistic drug combinations in the top 10 predicted results, MK2206 and AZD5363, MK2206 and AZD6244 to HCC1806 breast cancer cells.

In a molecule graph,  x i  ∈ V  is the  i -th atom and  e ij  ∈ E  is the chemical bond between the  i -th and  j - th atoms.

For each node in a graph, we use DeepChem (Ramsundar et al., 2019) to compute a set of atomic attributes as its initial feature. Speciﬁcally, each node is represented as a binary vector including ﬁve pieces of information: the atom symbol, the number of adjacent atoms, the number of adjacent hydrogen, the implicit value of the atom, and whether the atom is in an aromatic structure. In GNN, the learning process of drug representation is actually the message passing between each node and its neighbor nodes.

More precisely, we iteratively exclude each drug combination from the training set, use the remaining data to train the DeepDDS model that is in turn used to predict the sensitivity of the excluded drug combination to cancer cell lines. The result of the leave- one drug combination-out experiment is shown in Table 3, DeepDDS-GAT achieve notably performance by AUC value 0.89, followed by DeepDDS-GCN. It can be also found that DeepDDS signiﬁcantly outperform all other methods. As the leave-one drug combination-out experiment did not excluded single drug from the training set, we next leave one drug out to prevent the information of certain drug being seen by the model. The leave-one drug-out experiment check the potential to learn the important features of unseen drug from the chemical structures of those seen drugs. As shown in Table 3, DeepDDS still achieve better performance than other competitive methods. As previous studies (Liu and Xie, 2021), we also carried out leave-one cell line-out experiment to verify the performance of DeepDDS. Take the cell line T47D as an example, the drug combination between BEZ-235 and MK-8669, Dasatinib, Lapatinib, Geldanamycin, PD325901, Erlotinib, MK-4541, Temozolomide, Vinorelbine, ABT-888, all have a high experimental synergy scores (Loewe > 100). Expectedly, the prediction scores of these drug combinations have prior rankings among all candidate drug pairs (See Supplementary Table S2-S3 for detail). In addition to the leave-one cell line-out evaluation , Preuer et al., 2018), we adopt more rigorous strategy to evaluate our method. We exclude all the cancer cell lines belong to speciﬁc tissue from the training set, so that the model can not see any gene expression information of a certain type of tissue. We iteratively use the excluded cancer cell lines as the validation set and the remaining samples as the training set to train the model. Table 3 illustrated that DeepDDS- GAT achieve the best performance on leave-one tissue-out evaluation. Also, DeepDDS performs better than all classical machine learning methods and deep learning-based methods.

However, we noticed that the predictive accuracy of our method are still limited on the independent test set, although the performance of our method is greatly superior than all competitive methods. We think the limited performance is mainly attributed to the small number of training samples. In fact, the benchmark dataset actually includes only 38 unique drugs and 39 cancer cell lines, while the space for possible drug combinations is much larger when novel drugs are included Two diﬀerent graph neural network, GAT and GCN, are used to learn drug embedding vectors in our method. We extensively compared their performance to each other, as well as to quite a few competitive methods. Overall, GAT performs slightly better than GCN, and thus we further explored the interpretability of the GAT model. However, we have realized that the physicochemical properties of the molecular graph and attention weights between the atoms have not been fully understood. In the future, we are interested in studying the connections between atoms to incorporate more information resources into the DeepDDS model to improve the model interpretability and predictability.

Exper- imental studies are slow and costly. With quick accumulation of high-quality training data, a great number of computational methods for molecular property prediction have been developed [ 17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ], the goals of which are to reduce the need for extensive experimental validation and to accelerate the drug discovery process. Molecular properties can be classified into different categories based on their levels, from molecular level (e.g., quantum mechanics) to physiological level [ 21 ]. Computationally, the tasks of molecular prop- erty prediction can be categorized into two broad classes based on their inputs: predictions based on sin- gle molecules (i.e., drug candidates) [ 17 ,  22 ,  23 ], and predictions of relationships based on two or more molecules (e.g., drug-target or protein-ligand) [ 24 ,  25 ,  26 ]. The predictions based on single molecules can be either classification-based or regression-based. The goal of classification tasks is to predict the pres- ence/absence of certain properties. The regression tasks focus on the prediction of the quantitative value of a particular property of a molecule. Similarly, relationships among molecules [ 27 ,  28 ] can be represented by a binary value or a numerical value. Examples of the former include whether a protein and a target interact. The affinity score between two molecules is an example of the latter. Traditionally, drug property prediction heavily relied on classical machine learning techniques such as random forests or support vector machines [ 2 ], necessitating deep domain knowledge for feature engineer- ing. With the emergence of deep learning, there was a significant shift towards neural network based mod- els [ 2 ,  29 ]. This transition marked a move from one-dimensional string representations of drugs to richer two-dimensional graph and three-dimensional conformation models, broadening the scope and accuracy of drug property prediction.

However, as the number of possible drug combinations grows with the increasing number of available drugs, the potential for undetected and unexpected drug-drug interaction (DDIs) also rises [ 33 ]. Such interactions can lead to reduction of therapeutic effectiveness, adverse side effects [ 34 ], and sometimes increased hospitalization [ 35 ], posing significant challenges to the screening and optimization of combina- tional drug therapies. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods that can precisely predict the drug-drug synergies and adverse interactions to ensure safer and more effective treatments. Strictly speaking, drug combination therapies, which rely on synergistic or additive interactions of drugs to increase efficacy, reduce toxicity, and/or prevent drug resistance, can be treated as one type of drug- drug interactions. In this review, we use the broad definition of drug-drug interactions, which include both synergistic/additive as well as antagonistic/adverse interactions. To predict drug-drug interactions computa- tionally, the inputs usually include representations of drugs and types of interactions. In the simplest case, methods may only focus on the prediction of the existence of a particular type of interaction [ 36 ]. The problem is simply formulated as a binary classification problem. In other cases ( e.g. , data from cell-based assays), the relationships can be quantified based on one or multiple measures of individual drugs and/or drug pairs (e.g., half maximal inhibitory concentration or IC50), which can be viewed as regression tasks. Yet in some other cases (data from patient-based studies), different criteria or biomarkers ( e.g. , blood pres- sure, blood sugar) are considered and only a few categorical values ( e.g. , increasing, no change, decreasing) are considered for each criterion/biomarker. The problem can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem [ 37 ]. Over the years, many computational approaches have been developed for drug-drug interaction predic- tions [ 37 ,  36 ,  38 ,  39 ]. Earlier approaches were mostly based on traditional machine learning algorithms and/or matrix decomposition framework [ 38 ]. Some methods [ 40 ,  41 ,  42 ] can even take into considera- tions of patients’ medical history and recommend drugs that are safe to use for specific patients. More recently, more and more approaches based on deep learning models have drawn increasing attention, and have achieved better performance [ 38 ]. In particular, with advancements in the development of GNNs, methods that adapt GNNs as backbones to incorporate interactions as networks have achieved state-of-the- art results [ 42 ].",

      "refined_text": "For computational methods to generate promising drug candidates, a natural approach is to generate chem- ically valid molecules in the vicinity of existing drugs and drug candidates ( i.e. , known training data). In other words, computational models are typically trained on “hit molecules”–compounds that already ex- hibit desirable properties for drug development. Because there are no additional constraints on molecular substructures or chemical properties ( e.g. , binding affinity) imposed explicitly, such methods are classified as unconstrained. The primary goal of such approaches is to generate structurally valid and chemically plausible molecules with high diversity, guided by the distribution of the training data. GraphINVENT [ 56 ] is one of the initial explorations into unconstrained molecular graph generation, which explored various GNN architectures–such as gated GNNs and attention-based GNNs–to learn an “action” probability distribution from training molecules. The model then iteratively sampled one action at a time,  e.g. , adding a bond or an atom, until a “terminate generation” action was reached. Doing so allowed the approach to construct a molecule step by step. GraphINVENT is a representative among a broader class of models [ 57 ,  58 ,  59 ,  60 ] that all adopt such an iterative sampling strategy that build new graphs by repeatedly sampling components or actions from learned distributions. Beyond this one-piece-at-a-time paradigm, another type of method adopted generative frameworks that produce complete molecules (graphs) in a single pass. For instance, ConfVAE [ 61 ] integrated both 2D molecular graphs and 3D conformations, ensuring rotational and translational invariance. It employed a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework, with Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) for graph encoding, enabling end-to-end conditional molecule generation. While ConfVAE leveraged GNNs within a generative framework, VonMisesNet [ 7 ] took a different approach by focusing on capturing the re-",

These models employ GNN blocks to maintain structural consistency—ensuring robustness against flips, shifts, and rotations—while processing attributes and 3D coordinates of protein binding sites. Approaches such as the AR model [ 11 ] and GraphBP [ 12 ] introduced distinct strategies for representing atoms and binding environments. These models adopted various techniques to prioritize contextual representation and resilience to rigid transformations. For instance, AR combined MLP blocks with an auxiliary network to guide atom gen- eration and bonding decisions, whereas GraphBP utilized spherical coordinates alongside MLPs for se- quential atom-by-atom construction. Other notable methods, including Pocket2Mol [ 13 ] and FLAG [ 14 ], incorporated auxiliary MLP classifiers and predictors to optimize atom positioning and motif attachment. Collectively, these strategies significantly improved model robustness and adaptability, representing critical progress toward customizing molecules for specific protein targets—a key advancement in drug discovery. Each model has distinct strengths: the AR model emphasized specificity and binding affinity optimiza- tion for particular protein site structures; GraphBP introduced a dual-diffusion architecture to enhance flex- ibility; Pocket2Mol achieved greater computational efficiency through conditional 3D coordinate sampling; and FLAG leveraged motif-based generation to improve structural realism and diversity. Beyond generating molecules that bind to specific protein sites, there is also a growing need to gener- ate molecules constrained by a desired 3D binding conformation. In many cases, experimental data reveal that certain binding postures are particularly effective for interacting with specific proteins, and generating candidate molecules that adopt these conformations can greatly accelerate screening. SQUID [ 15 ] was the first model designed to address this challenge. Given a target 3D shape, SQUID encodes the input confor- mation—treated as an unordered point cloud—into hidden features using GNN layers, and then iteratively generates 3D molecular fragments that reconstruct the desired shape fragment-by-fragment.",

For example, MGSSL [ 63 ] introduced a motif-based graph self-supervised learning framework that exploited rich information in subgraphs often overlooked at the node level. In this setting, the choice of molecular fragmentation method is critical, as poor fragmentation can lead to suboptimal motif generation and degraded model performance. Many other methods adopt contrastive graph learning as their pre-training strategy. MoCL [ 18 ], for in- stance, utilized knowledge-aware contrastive learning informed by local and global domain knowledge. Lo- cal domain knowledge ensured semantic invariance during augmentation, while global domain knowledge infused structural similarity across the learning process. Nevertheless, designing augmentation schemes that generalize across diverse molecular structures remains challenging. KCL [ 64 ] combined contrastive learn- ing with domain-specific knowledge graphs, offering tailored augmentations at the cost of generalizability. MCHNN [ 65 ] applied multi-view contrastive learning with task-specific augmentations, enhancing the ex- pressiveness of molecular representations.

SphereNet [ 45 ] introduced an innovative approach for 3D molecular representation learning, proposing a spherical message-passing scheme that explicitly incorporates 3D spatial information. While SphereNet demonstrated strong predictive performance, it lacked transparency and interpretability, which hinders the understanding of its decision-making processes. MolKGNN [ 74 ] addressed this limitation in the context of quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. It enhanced 3D molecular representation learning by employing molecular graph convolution with learnable molecular kernels, effectively capturing chemical patterns. Importantly, MolKGNN incorporated molecular chirality, a critical aspect often neglected in previous models. However, the method emphasizes distinguishing specific molecular substructures, which may limit its generalizability across diverse chemical variations encountered in practical drug discovery scenarios.

However, such approaches may risk overfitting, as evidenced by performance variability across different datasets. UnifiedPML [ 76 ] further improved representation learning by jointly considering 2D and 3D information in its pre-training scheme. The framework employed three complementary tasks: reconstruction of masked atoms and coordinates, generation of 3D conformations conditioned on 2D graphs, and generation of 2D graphs conditioned on 3D conformations. GeomGCL [ 77 ] adopted a dual-channel message-passing neural network to effectively capture both topological and geometric features of molecular graphs. MoleculeSDE [ 78 ] unified 2D and 3D molecular representations by treating them as separate modalities in a multi-modal pre-training framework. 3D-PGT [ 79 ] proposed a generative pre-training approach on 3D molecular graphs, which was subsequently fine-tuned on molecules lacking 3D structural data. It employed a multi-task learning strategy based on three geometric descriptors–bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles–and used total molecular energy as an optimization target. While promising, the effectiveness of this framework remains to be validated on larger and more structurally complex molecules, as current evaluations have primarily focused on small molecules.",

      "refined_text": "Beyond property prediction, interaction prediction has been extensively explored, especially for drug-target or drug -disease interaction predictions. Many researchers (e.g., NeurTN [ 17 ]) have utilized drug-target interaction networks as input, where the nodes are drugs and targets and links are known drug-target rela- tionship. These models typically infer new interactions based on the guilt-by-association principle and are fundamentally different from the methods discussed in this work, which rely primarily on drugs’ structure information represented as molecular graphs. Therefore, interaction network based approaches are excluded from further discussion in this section. In drug discovery, one of the most critical and extensively studied relationships is the interaction between drugs (or chemical compounds) and their protein targets. In the literature, various terms are used to describe these interactions, each emphasizing different aspects. These include drug-target interaction, protein-ligand interaction, drug-target binding affinity, protein-ligand binding affinity, molecular docking. Computation- ally, given the 2D or 3D structures of two molecules, the interaction can be studied at three levels: (1) binary interaction ( i.e. , whether an interaction occurs), (2) binding affinity (a numerical value, typically reflecting binding free energy), and (3) docking or protein-ligand binding dynamics. GNN-based approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions based on their 2D struc- ture. For example, CGIB [ 28 ] predicted interactions primarily using substructure information from paired graphs. MGraphDTA [ 27 ] predicted drug–target binding affinities based on 2D compound graphs and pro- tein sequences. It utilized a deep GNN to capture both local and global molecular structures and a multi- scale convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from protein sequences. However, capturing long-range dependencies within complex molecular graphs remains a challenge for such models. Given the superior performance generally observed when utilizing 3D molecular geometries, the trend shows that more approaches incorporate 3D information for interaction prediction, especially for binding affinity prediction and docking. For binding affinity prediction, the inputs are usually protein-ligand complexes, and the objective is to predict a binding score that reflects the strength of interaction, typically in terms of free energy. Recent developments have leveraged 3D graph representation learning to tackle this problem. For instance, Jones",

Their method utilized a 3D CNN to capture local spatial features and a spatial GNN to encode global structural information, integrating both in a fused architecture. The IGN framework [ 80 ] modeled protein-ligand complexes using three distinct molecular graphs, each incorporating both 3D structural and chemical properties. MP-GNN [ 81 ] introduced a multiphysical molec- ular graph representation, which systematically captured a wide range of molecular interactions across dif- ferent atom types and physical scales. However, most existing biomolecular GNNs rely on covalent-bond- based graph constructions, which often fail to effectively characterize non-covalent interactions essential for modeling biomolecular complexes. GraphscoreDTA [ 82 ] advanced this field by integrating a bitransport information mechanism and Vina distance optimization terms to better capture the mutual information between proteins and ligands. This method also highlighted critical atomic and residue-level features. In contrast to the above, NERE [ 25 ] proposed an unsupervised approach to binding energy prediction, framing it as a generative modeling task. Their method, based on Neural Euler’s Rotation Equations (NERE), predicted molecular rotations by mod- eling the forces and torques between ligand and protein atoms. However, the current implementation of NERE for antibody modeling only considers backbone atoms and omits side-chain atoms, which are crucial for accurately estimating binding affinity. Docking, a central process in drug discovery, has also seen innovation through GNN-based approaches. E3Bind [ 26 ] introduced an end-to-end model that directly generates ligand coordinates, thus eliminating the need for traditional sampling procedures and coordinate reconstructions. Similarly, FABind [ 83 ] com- bined pocket prediction and docking in an integrated model for fast and accurate binding pose prediction. A unique ligand-informed pocket prediction module was used to guide the docking process, with successive refinements optimizing the ligand-protein binding pose. The model further enhanced the docking process by incrementally integrating the predicted pockets to optimize protein-ligand binding. However, ablation stud- ies indicated that different components contribute to the model’s performance in varying degrees, suggesting potential inefficiencies in the overall architecture. More recently, NeuralMD [ 84 ] provided a fine-grained simulation of protein-ligand binding dynamics. The model included BindingNet, which adhered to group symmetry and captured multi-level interactions, and a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver that modeled the physical trajectories of atoms based on Newtonian mechanics. EquiPocket [ 85 ], distinct from the aforementioned methods, focused specifically on predicting ligand binding sites for given 3D protein structures. It introduced three novel modules: a local geometric modeling module to extract features from individual surface atoms, a global structural module to encode the chem- ical and spatial context of the entire protein, and a surface message-passing module to learn surface-level geometric patterns. In contrast to CNN-based methods, which suffer from inefficiencies due to voxelization of irregular protein surfaces, EquiPocket avoids computational redundancy and excessive memory usage through its surface-based geometric design.",

With advancements in the field, more recent methods have begun to incorporate drug molecular structures, represented as molecular graphs (as introduced previously), in which nodes de- note atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. In both types of graphs, nodes and edges are typically enriched with additional features or attributes that capture relevant properties. For example, in drug–drug interaction graphs, node attributes may encode drug-specific properties, while edges can be labeled to indi- cate interaction types (e.g., synergistic or antagonistic effects). In molecular graphs, node features represent atomic properties, and edge features describe bond characteristics. GNN-based models are capable of pro- cessing both graph types, often alongside auxiliary information such as drug similarity matrices, to learn latent representations from different perspectives and at multiple levels—capturing both relational patterns in drug interaction networks and structural characteristics at molecular and sub-molecular scales.

      "refined_text": "The choice of input data and their representations not only inspires model design but also significantly in- fluences problem formulations. Early models primarily focused on drug–drug interaction graphs combined with simple node-level drug features. Various GNN architectures were employed to learn low-dimensional representations of drugs from these graphs [ 97 ,  98 ]. Building on this idea, models such as GCNMK [ 36 ] further decomposed the DDI graph into two separate graphs, one representing interactions where a drug in- creases the activity of another, and the other where it decreases activity, and applied two GNNs to learn drug representations from these differentiated views. Subsequent studies expanded the input space by incorpo- rating drug molecular graphs, thereby enabling the integration of both structural and relational perspectives to enhance model performance. For instance, MRCGNN [ 39 ] employed a GNN to process the relational DDI graph while enriching each drug’s feature representation with molecular-level information extracted by a separate GNN operating on its molecular graph. This multimodal approach allowed the model to simulta- neously capture both chemical and interaction-level knowledge. The evolution of problem formulation also extends to the design of prediction tasks. Some models framed DDI prediction as a binary classification problem, aiming solely to determine the existence of an interaction [ 98 ]. Others formulated it as a multi-label classification task, predicting both the presence and the specific type of interaction from a predefined label set [ 99 ,  100 ,  101 ,  102 ]. Many researchers have further distinguished between adverse DDI prediction [ 103 ,  104 ,  105 ] and drug combination or synergy prediction [ 106 ,  105 ,  107 ,  108 ], providing a more nuanced understanding of interaction consequences. Overall, advancements in problem formulation aim to enrich input representations with biologically meaningful information and to enable more fine-grained, application-specific predictions. Future directions are likely to emphasize input data that better reflect the underlying biological complexity of DDIs. For the prediction outcomes, knowledge of specific side effects from adverse interaction prediction and information of targeted diseases in drug combination modeling are welcome additions.",

Each complex undergoes structural refinement and quantum-mechanical optimization to address stereochemical, geometric, and protonation inconsistencies. Around 17,000 com- plexes are further subjected to explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This dynamic data captures conformational flexibility and binding pocket dynamics. In addition, MISATO includes quantum- derived electronic descriptors, partial charges, and preprocessing utilities tailored for machine learning pipelines. By integrating static structures with time-resolved dynamics, MISATO enables modeling of tran- sient binding states and induced-fit effects, overcoming the limitations of single-conformation datasets. CrossDocked  [ 121 ] curates 18,450 non-redundant protein–ligand complexes derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 132 ], using a systematic cross-docking approach. Ligands are docked into non-cognate, structurally similar binding pockets to produce a diverse set of over 22.5 million binding poses. The dataset features cluster-based predefined splits for evaluating model generalizability to unseen targets and provides dual metrics for assessing both pose accuracy and binding affinity predictions. By modulating the structural similarity between docking receptors and their native counterparts, CrossDocked enables rigorous evaluation of docking algorithms under realistic scenarios where exact receptor structures may be unknown.

      "refined_text": "In recent years, deep learning approaches – particularly GNNs – have garnered increasing attention in the field of computational drug discovery. In this survey, we systematically review studies published since 2021, highlighting the significant role GNNs have played across three core application areas: molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and drug–drug interaction prediction. We examine how GNNs effectively model chemical structures and capture complex molecular patterns, discussing the strengths and limitations of current approaches, along with the major challenges faced by the research community. The papers included in this review represent state-of-the-art advancements in the field and demonstrate that molecular graph representation learning has become a dominant paradigm across these applications. Specifically, we observe that GNNs have been instrumental in advancing molecule generation by en- abling the design of novel compounds with desired properties through both unconstrained and constrained generation strategies. In the area of molecular property prediction, the shift towards utilizing 3D molecular graphs has led to more accurate and robust outcomes, particularly when combined with message-passing mechanisms and contrastive learning techniques. For DDI prediction, GNNs have opened promising av- enues in personalized medicine by identifying safe and effective drug combinations tailored to individual patient profiles. This is especially impactful for drug repurposing, where GNNs can significantly accelerate the development of combinatorial therapies. Across the reviewed studies, several common trends emerge. First, pre-training and self-supervised learning have become widespread, substantially enhancing the performance of GNN-based models. These techniques are particularly effective in mitigating the issue of limited labeled data and contribute to the development of more generalizable models. Second, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge into GNN architectures has led to noticeable improvements in model performance, suggesting a movement to- ward more specialized and biologically informed models. Third, many recent works adopt multi-modal approaches that integrate diverse input formats, including 2D and 3D molecular graphs, as well as SMILES strings, sometimes combining GNNs with other deep learning architectures. This fusion of complementary molecular representations enables a more comprehensive understanding of the data and has the potential to significantly enhance predictive performance. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain, which also point to promising future directions. First, as previously discussed, data scarcity and the limited availability of high-quality, diverse datasets con- tinue to constrain the full potential of GNNs in drug discovery. Second, the interpretability of GNN models remains a critical hurdle that must be addressed to foster trust and facilitate their adoption in real-world applications. As GNN architectures grow increasingly complex, ensuring interpretability is paramount. As emphasized by Henderson et al. [ 135 ], future research should prioritize models that not only provide accurate predictions but also offer clear explanations for their decisions. Bridging this gap between computational predictions and human understanding will be essential for generating actionable scientific insights. Lastly, multi-omics integration approaches combine data from various biological levels (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, etc.) to create a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.

However, GNNs incur high computational costs on large-scale KGs [ 1 ] and criti- cally fail to generalize to unseen entities [ 18 ], a drawback in drug discovery where new drugs and diseases continuously emerge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, ex- celling in zero-shot reasoning and inductive generalization [ 3 ,  4 ,  23 ]. Recent works have shown that LLMs can be grounded in KGs to enhance factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations in specialized domains [ 2 ,  3 ,  14 ,  41 ]. However, extracting meaningful insights from KGs using LLMs is an ongoing challenge [ 15 ,  33 ]. Current approaches to KG integration often exhibit limitations.

Addressing these limitations is crucial for developing a generalizable and scalable framework for drug discovery.

This formula- tion establishes an inductive reasoning setting, enabling predictions beyond observed edges. K-Paths is training-free and operates in three steps as shown in fig. 2. First, it augments the biomedical KG by integrating observed interactions from training data, enhancing its representation of interactions. This enriched KG serves as the network for retrieving biologically meaningful connections. Next, it retrieves biologically meaningful connections using our diversity-aware adaptation of Yen’s algorithm [ 44 ]. While Yen’s algorithm iteratively finds alter- native shortest paths, our adaptation prioritizes relational diversity and biological relevance over redundant shortest-path variations. Finally, the retrieved paths are transformed into natural language representations, enabling LLMs to reason over them and effectively predict interactions. These paths can also be used to construct task- specific subgraphs, allowing GNN models to operate on a more focused graph and substantially reducing computational overhead. We evaluate K-Paths in both zero-shot generative and supervised learning settings on drug repurposing and drug–drug interaction (DDI) tasks involving emerging entities.

For LLM-based reasoning, we employ a suite of models  LLaMA- 3.1-8B-Instruct  and  LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct  [ 13 ],  Tx-Gemma- 9B-Chat  and  Tx-Gemma-27B-Chat  [ 37 ], as well as  Qwen2.5- 14B-Instruct  and  Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct  [ 43 ] as our primary in- ference models, leveraging their instruction-following capabilities. In zero-shot settings, we utilize direct prompting to evaluate their reasoning ability. In supervised settings, we fine-tuned Llama-3.1- 8B-Instruct using QLoRA, a lightweight and efficient fine-tuning approach. In both these experiments, we generate the output with a greedy decoding. For GNN architectures, we use Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (RGCN) because of their ability to han- dle relational data, which aligns with our task. Additionally, we adopt EmerGNN’s backbone architecture, as it is the current state- of-the-art inductive graph-based model for drug-drug interaction prediction tasks.",

Table 2 presents results across multiple LLM sizes and domains on the DDInter, PharmacotherapyDB, and DrugBank datasets. Consistent improvements with K-Paths:  Across all datasets, LLMs significantly benefit from K-Paths, outperforming both Base and Definitions settings. On DDInter, K-Paths boosts the F1-score by 13.42 for Llama 3.1 8B and 6.18 for Llama 3.1 70B, compared to the Definitions setting. Similar gains appear on PharmacotherapyDB with improvements of 12.45 (8B) and 8.46 (70B). The Tx-Gemma models (9B/27B), specifically fine-tuned for therapeutic tasks, show remarkable gains with K-Paths—achieving 29.2 and 19.8 point F1- score improvements on DDInter, respectively. In some cases, Defi- nitions slightly improve performance over Base or even degrade it, but they consistently fall short of the substantial gains achieved with K-Paths. This gap likely stems from the nature of the informa- tion provided. K-Paths offers structured, contextualized knowledge, showing how entities are related. Definitions, while informative, provide declarative knowledge that lacks crucial relational context, needed for LLMs to reason about interactions effectively. The harder the task, the larger the gap:  DrugBank involves 86 interaction types. In the Base setting, most models hover around 1% F1 or 19% BERTScore, whereas with K-Paths they achieve 30–40%, emphasizing the importance of structured external knowledge in such complex tasks. K-Paths eases need for scale & domain-specific models: Larger models generally outperform smaller ones in the Base set- ting (e.g., 70B vs. 8B Llama), but these gains diminish with external knowledge. Surprisingly, on DDInter, smaller models (8B Llama, Qwen 14B) occasionally outperform their larger counterparts when using K-Paths, suggesting high-quality external knowledge can reduce reliance on model scale. Likewise, Tx-Gemma’s domain- specific pre-training only helps consistently on Pharmacothera- pyDB. However, their performance varies across datasets, suggest- ing domain specialization doesn’t guarantee optimal reasoning. These results demonstrate that structured reasoning paths provide benefits for zero-shot interaction prediction, often outweighing the benefits of model scale or domain-specific pretraining.",

LLM performance:  We fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct using K-Paths and textual definitions. As shown in table 5, fine-tuned LLMs perform comparably regardless of the training source, indi- cating their ability to integrate both structured and unstructured knowledge when supervision is provided. However, we further ob- serve that definitions often outperform K-Paths, likely because they provide a more direct and semantically rich signal that is easier to learn; in contrast, in the zero-shot setting (section 5.1), K-Paths provide more useful relational cues. GNN performance:  We compared GNN models trained on the full knowledge graph (Complete KG) against those trained on the subgraphs constructed from the K-Paths framework. Table 4 shows that with K-Paths, we achieve comparable accuracy to using the Complete KG despite being approximately 90% smaller. This rein- forces that smaller, task-specific graphs enhance efficiency without significant performance loss. For example, on DDInter, EmerGNN achieves nearly identical performance using K-Paths (F1: 68.85%)",

      "refined_text": "compared to Complete KG (F1: 68.00%), suggesting that a targeted subgraph retains essential knowledge while significantly improv- ing efficiency. RGCN benefits from K-Paths, with F1 increasing from 51.47% (Complete KG) to 52.12% (K-Paths) on DDInter and from 15.49% to 17.51% on DrugBank. This highlights the advantage of a more focused graph structure for such models. This result is consistent in the transductive setting shown in appendix F.2. Efficiency analysis:  Table 5 presents a comparison of graph statistics and training times before and after applying K-Paths for subgraph retrieval, along with the retrieval duration in minutes. The results clearly show that K-Paths substantially reduces the num- ber of nodes, relations, and triplets, leading to significantly faster training and lower memory overhead. For instance, on DrugBank, the number of nodes reduces from 35,103 to 6,335, and triplets from 1,789,976 to 184,273. Correspondingly, EmerGNN’s training time per epoch drops from 1011.86s to 146.98s.. A similar trend is ob- served in DDInter, where subgraph pruning leads to a speedup from 606.24s to 102.21s per epoch. Note that K-Paths includes reverse edges during retrieval, effectively doubling the triplet count. De- spite this, the total retrieval time remains under 15 minutes for all datasets. We see a similar trend in table 8 for the test data and show the important relations retained by K-Paths in appendix F.4. These results highlight that K-Paths improves training efficiency without compromising model performance, reinforcing the scalability of our approach.",

      "refined_text": "We present  K-Paths , a model-agnostic retrieval framework that introduces a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen’s algorithm to ex- tract biologically meaningful, multi-hop reasoning paths from large biomedical KGs. These paths serve as structured, relational evi- dence that supports both prediction and interpretability across model types. Our experiments show that K-Paths benefits both LLMs and GNNs. For LLMs, the retrieved paths serve as useful con- text that enables zero-shot, inductive reasoning about unobserved drug–disease interactions. For GNNs, K-Paths identifies compact subgraphs, reducing graph size by up to 90% while maintaining performance and improving training efficiency. While our focus is on repurposing and interaction prediction, K-Paths is potentially generalizable to other biomedical tasks such as protein–protein interaction prediction or treatment recommendation. We acknowl- edge limitations: K-Paths relies on existing interaction types and graph connectivity, which may limit its ability to infer entirely novel interaction types or handle sparsely represented entities. Neverthe- less, by anchoring predictions in relationally diverse paths, K-Paths mitigates hallucinations and supports biologically grounded infer- ence. To our knowledge, K-Paths is one of the first frameworks to enable path-based heuristics for reasoning over unseen drug pairs, a critical need for early-stage drug discovery. We believe this work lays a foundation for future exploration of integrating LLMs and KGs in biomedical applications, paving the way for more efficient and interpretable solutions in drug discovery and other related fields.",
